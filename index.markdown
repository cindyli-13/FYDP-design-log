The ankle the is most commonly injured body part during sports, with ankle inversion sprains accounting for over 80% of all ankle injuries.
</em><br><p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:140%; color:grey; font-weight:200;"><em><br>
Existing braces that provide enough protection to the ankle are often too stiff and limit the ankle's full range of motion.
</em><br><p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:140%; color:grey; font-weight:200;"><em><br>
We are designing a smart brace solution to prevent ankle injury while still providing the freedom of motion needed during athletic activities.
