<p style="text-align: center; font-size:140%;"><em>
The ankle the is most commonly injured body part during sports, with ankle inversion sprains accounting for over 80% of all ankle injuries.
</em><br><p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:140%;"><em><br>
Existing braces that provide enough protection to the ankle are often too stiff and limit the ankle's full range of motion.
</em><br><p>
