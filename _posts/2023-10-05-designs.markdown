We brainstormed 2 viable design solutions to the ankle brace problem (and 1 non-viable solution).

1. Seatbelt mechanism (binary tension / no tension) with gear ratcheting mechanism
2. Seatbelt mechanism (binary tension / no tension) with linear rack / pinion ratcheting mechanism
3. Attach drone to the bottom of foot
