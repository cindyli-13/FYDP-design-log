The drone idea got scrapped - our 3rd design solution is now directly controlling brace stiffness with a motor spooling a cable.

Here are some sketches of the 3 design solutions that give a better idea of how they work.

### Design #1
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/design_1_sketch.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/><br>
<em>Seatbelt mechanism with gear ratcheting mechanism</em><br>
</p>

### Design #2
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/design_2_sketch.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/><br>
<em>Seatbelt mechanism with linear rack / pinion ratcheting mechanism</em><br>
</p>

### Design #3
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/design_3_sketch.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/><br>
<em>Direct motor control of cable spooling</em><br>
</p>
