The foot sleeve is the flexible sleeve component that the user wears on the foot. It provides a mounting point for the second IMU as well as the cable.

The first iteration of the foot sleeve is 3D printed using TPU. It fits on the model foot really well but could be reduced in size to give more comfort to the user.

For the second iteration, the top part of the foot sleeve is left open to be velcro-strapped to the foot. This allows for a more customized fit on different foot sizes, and also reduces the material needed. The sleeve is also made thinner than V1, so it is much lighter. The IMU will be mounted close to the heel with adhesive velcro.

This iteration still had some issues. The slots for the velcro strap are cut too close to the edge and were likely to shear off after wear and tear. Also, the sleeve's fit is more loose and easily falls off the foot.

For the third iteration, a second velcro strap is added to better secure the sleeve to the foot. The slots for the velcro straps are also moved lower to remove the weak points.
