Further research into ankle inversion injury studies provided us with these guiding stats:

1. Ankle inversion time (from start of inversion to moment of injury) based on ground impact force varies from 40ms to serveral hundred ms. [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8947403/)
2. The angular velocity threshold for ankle inversion injury is ~400 deg/s. [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9983046/)

[BetterGuards](https://betterguards.de/en) (our competitor) has done extensive studies into this space - their research supports our basis that there is great merit to an ankle inversion prevension device that provides freedom of movement in other directions of ankle motion:

> Athletes prone to reinjury after lateral ankle sprain may benefit from brace designs that allow for full sagittal range of motion but restrict only frontal plane motion. [[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6498751/)

We just need to make our product to be better than BetterGuard's (call it the BettererGuard).
