## New Features on Rev 2 PCB

### USB Charger circuit

<em>USB Charger Circuit</em>
</p>

Using the 5V USB input pin on ESP dev board, the circuit charges the lipo battery with 500mA maximum charge current.

- Q6 detects whether the battery is connected or not. When battery is disconnected, Q5 disconnects the charger from battery rail.
- STAT LED lights up while the battery charging is in progress.


### System Power Switch

Q4 connected with slide switch (soldered with wires on J4 and J5) can disconnect the system from the battery when the systemâ€™s not in use.

## Reworks done on Rev 2 PCB

- R21 Pull-up resistor is moved to pull-down, as pull-down at Q2 gate provides better protection against shoot through in open-load, power-up situation compared to pull-up on Q1.
- R23 resistance is changed to 1kR from 10kR to increase charging speed of C17. 1kR is high enough to prevent significant amount of current from being pulled during actuation.
- C17 capacitor value is increased to 820 uF to provide stronger initial push.
